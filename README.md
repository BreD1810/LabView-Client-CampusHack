# LabView-Client
This is the client for the LabView project by KirkStars, written at CampusHack2018.

This webpage is written in C#, in .NET Core. It communicates with the Java server found [here](https://github.com/BreD1810/LabView-Server).

Ideally, it should be run as a background task, started when the user is logged in. It should not spawn a console window, so it should appear hidden from the user.
